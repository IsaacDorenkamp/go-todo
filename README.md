Go To-Do
========

This simple Go project can be run in one simple line:

```
$ go run .
```

If you wish to build a binary first, you can do the following instead:

```
$ go build
$ ./go-todo
```

Tests
-----

To run this project's testing mode (just some simple tests of the database model operations), you can run the project with the command-line argument `test`:

```
$ go run . test
```

or

```
$ go build
$ ./go-todo test
```
